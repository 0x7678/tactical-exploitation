> "The Other Way to Pen-Test" --HD Moore & Valsmith

I've always been a big proponent of a tactical approach to penetration testing that does not focus on exploiting known software vulnerabilities, but relies on old school techniques such as information gathering and brute force. While being able to appreciate the occasional usefulness of a well-timed 0day, as a veteran penetration tester I favor an exploit-less approach. Tactical exploitation provides a smoother and more reliable way of compromising targets by leveraging process vulnerabilities, while minimizing attack detection and other undesired side effects.

This repository aims to provide a tactical exploitation toolkit to assist penetration testers during their assignments. The tools currently released are:

* **easywin.py**. Windows and Active Directory information gathering and brute force tool.

See also http://www.0xdeadbeef.info/ for some older tools and techniques.
