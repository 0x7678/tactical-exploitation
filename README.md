> "The Other Way to Pen-Test" --HD Moore & Valsmith

I've always been a big proponent of a tactical approach to penetration testing that does not focus on exploiting known software vulnerabilities, but relies on old school techniques such as information gathering and brute force. While being able to appreciate the occasional usefulness of a well-timed 0day, as a veteran penetration tester I favor an exploit-less approach. Tactical exploitation provides a smoother and more reliable way of compromising targets by leveraging process vulnerabilities, while minimizing attack detection and other undesired side effects.

This repository aims to provide a tactical exploitation toolkit to assist penetration testers during their assignments. The tools currently released are described below. See also http://www.0xdeadbeef.info/ for some older tools and techniques.

*These tools are proofs of concept. They are functional but may be buggy or incomplete. Use at your own risk.*

## easywin.py

Easywin is a Python script that provides a toolkit for exploit-less attacks aimed at Windows and Active Directory environments, by leveraging information gathering and brute force capabilities against the SMB protocol.

## letmein.py

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xdea/tactical-exploitation/master/img/letmein.jpg)

Letmein is a pure Python 3 implementation of the staging protocol used by the Metasploit Framework. Just start an exploit/multi/handler (Generic Payload Handler) instance on your attack box with either a reverse_tcp or bind_tcp Meterpreter payload, then run letmein (ideally converted to EXE format) on a compromised Windows box and wait for your session. This technique is quite effective in order to bypass the antivirus and obtain a Meterpreter shell on Windows.

## poriluk.py

Poriluk is a helper script that provides a comfortable interface to exploit common information leakage vulnerabilities. At the moment, the following attacks are supported: dictionary-based user enumeration via SMPT VRFY/EXPN/RCPT and HTTP Apache mod_userdir.
